         -  *solver* - (:class:`pyclaw.Solver`) The PyClaw-solver used for advancing this subgrid in time.

                            for the actual solving of the timestep on the subgrid.
         -  *q* - The array storing the current solution.
         -  *qbc* - The array storing the solution of the last timestep including the ghostlayer.
         -  *position* - A d-dimensional tuple holding the position of the grid in the computational domain.
                         This measures the continuous real-world position in floats, not the integer position

                                    square subgrids are allowed, so the total number of cells in the subgrid
                                    (excluding the ghostlayer) is subdivision_factor x subdivision_factor.
         -  *unknowns_per_cell* - The number of equations or unknowns that are stored per cell of the subgrid.
